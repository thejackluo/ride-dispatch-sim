🛺 Ride Dispatch System – Technical
Assessment
Design and implement a simplified ride-hailing backend system using FastAPI,
along with a basic frontend to visualize and simulate the system. The platform
should operate in a grid-based city where riders request rides, and drivers are
dispatched based on ETA, fairness, and availability.
You’ll build the system from scratch — backend, logic, and UI
🎯 Objectives
You will implement:
A FastAPI backend to manage the city grid, drivers, riders, and ride requests
Dispatch logic to assign drivers to ride requests
A fallback mechanism when drivers reject rides
A simple frontend UI to:
Visualize the grid
Add/remove drivers and riders
Request rides
Advance simulated time ( tick )
See current system state

🗺 Environment
The city is a 2D grid (e.g., 100×100).
Drivers and riders exist at (x, y) coordinates.

Engineering Take Home Interview: 1

Time advances manually through a /tick endpoint.
Movement happens one unit per tick unless you document otherwise.
No real-time behavior or persistence is needed — in-memory simulation is
fine.

🧩 System Requirements
1. Entities
Driver
Unique ID
Current location (x, y)
Status: available , on_trip , or offline
Rider
Unique ID
Pickup location (x, y)
Dropoff location (x, y)
RideRequest
Rider ID
Pickup and dropoff locations
Status: waiting , assigned , rejected , completed , or failed

2. Flow
A rider requests a ride via the API or frontend.
The system finds the best available driver based on the dispatch logic goals
defined below.
The driver can accept or reject.

Engineering Take Home Interview: 2

If rejected, the system tries the next-best driver.
Once accepted, the driver moves toward pickup → dropoff location.
Movement updates occur on each /tick .

3. Dispatch Logic Goals
Design your dispatch logic to balance:
Goal Description
Low ETA Assign drivers with shortest travel time to pickup
Fairness Ensure no driver gets all requests; distribute evenly
Efficiency Maximize fulfilled rides; minimize idle drivers
Fallbacks Retry with other drivers if the first one rejects
You may define and document your own algorithms — creativity is encouraged!
💻 Frontend Requirements
You must build a basic browser-based UI (no need for styling). It should let users:
Add/remove drivers and riders
Request a ride
Trigger the next time tick (e.g., a "Next Tick" button)
Visualize drivers, riders, and trips on the grid
Any front end framework is fine.
📦 Deliverables
Submit a GitHub repo or zip file containing:
✅ FastAPI backend
✅ Basic frontend UI
✅ README with:
How to run the system

Engineering Take Home Interview: 3

How your dispatching works
Any assumptions or simplifications you made
🧪 Evaluation Criteria
Category What We’re Looking For
✅ Correctness Are ride requests assigned and completed correctly?
🧠 Dispatch
Logic Is your logic well-thought-out and documented?
🧹 Code Quality Is the code clean, modular, and understandable?
🔁 Extensibility

Is your system designed in a way that could scale or support future
features?

🔖 Notes
You do not need authentication, persistent databases, or real-time sockets.
The system can run entirely locally and use in-memory storage.
You may define default driver speed, ETA calculation method, or rejection
behavior — just explain all assumptions in the README.
Good luck! We're excited to see your approach and engineering decisions 🚀
